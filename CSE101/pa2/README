README:
Outlines purposes/functions and names of files that are to be submitted.

Sparse.c:
Purpose: To carry out Matrix operations on the matrices from the input file and outputs the results into the output files.

Matrix.c: Contains the functions that perform the Matrix ADT Operations. Ran out of time and was worried about other classes so I can't finish this yet.

Matrix.h: Contains the all Matrix ADT function headers and typedefs.

List.c: Contains all the fucntions that perfrom List ADT Operations.

List.h: Contains all the List ADT function headers and typedefs.

Makefile: Compiles the necessary files to be run.

MatrixTest.c & ListTest.c: Admittedly these files do not contain many additions to the ListClient and MatrixClient files. The way I tested my Matrix and List ADTs using these files was to isolate certain operations, such as the first call to changeEntry(), to block test them. In this way I was able to properly create the functions that I was able to include. I still have trouble figuring out how to free the Entry object that Node->index points to.
