## My process

First, I outlined in my mind the structure of the elements. I saw a rounded and centered card component with a rounded image and centered text below.
Second, I layed out the html for each of the elements. A outer card div, with an image and a div to contain the header h2 and paragraph below.
Third, I applied the styles starting with the body. I adjusted the background color, height, and set display to flex. Then I rounded the borders of the img and card div while applying a light shadow. Finally, I change the img size and fonts to match the design specifications.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun practice problem. I had to look up the box-shadow arguments.

### Continued development

I didn't know how to set the footer to stay at the bottom without messing the rest of it up.
